# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Custom agent types with graceful fallback** (2026-03-06): Added `filler` and `audit` custom agent types in `prompts/agents/` with frontmatter for tool enforcement and observability. Filler type enforces Invariant I2 (read-only, cannot execute in sandbox). Audit type enforces Invariant I1 (sandbox-scoped execution only). Skill updated to use custom types with automatic fallback to `general-purpose` if not installed. Optional installation via symlinks to `~/.claude/agents/`. Provides separate success rates in claudewatch metrics and structural tool restrictions. Pattern matches scout-and-wave implementation. Zero breaking changes. ([commit 71cb6ee](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/agentic-cold-start-audit/commit/71cb6ee))
- **CLAUDE.md navigation guide** (2026-03-06): Added comprehensive AI agent instructions documenting project structure, core principles, architecture, and key conventions. Emphasizes pure discovery methodology and sandbox isolation invariants. ([commit 71cb6ee](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/agentic-cold-start-audit/commit/71cb6ee))
- **Claude Code sandboxing integration note** (2026-03-06): Added documentation explaining how Claude Code's built-in OS-level sandboxing complements the protocol's application-level isolation. Two independent defense layers working together. Not required but recommended for enhanced protection.
- Audit prompt template with variable table, severity tiers, and structured findings format
- Filler agent prompt that auto-discovers tool metadata from `--help` output and environment
- Workflow guide with prerequisites, permissions setup, launch steps, and triage process
- Sandbox setup guide covering container design, Dockerfile patterns, and docker exec vs bind mount access patterns
- Self-contained Claude Code `/cold-start-audit` skill with inline setup, permissions, Dockerfile patterns, and audit template
- Quickstart section in README with 3-command example
- Example output from real brewprune audit (21 findings)
- `init` subcommand for scaffolding `.claude/settings.json` permissions
- Multi-package-manager support in filler agent (apt, apk, Homebrew, none)
- **Timestamp metadata in audit reports** (2026-02-28): Audit report template now includes metadata header with Audit Date, Tool Version, Container name, and Environment. Makes staleness visible and helps prioritize findings based on when they were discovered. Enables tracking which version was audited without implying the agent verifies previous findings. ([commit 67958a5](https://github.com/anthropics/agentic-cold-start-audit/commit/67958a5))
- **Container lifecycle documentation** (2026-02-28): Container Setup section now clarifies the three-tier distinction between Dockerfile (stable infrastructure template), image (rebuilt per round from source changes), and container (ephemeral running instance). Separates first-time setup from subsequent rounds. Prevents unnecessary Dockerfile recreation when only source code changed. Recommends round-specific naming (mytool-r1, mytool-r2) for clarity. ([commit b7a5a41](https://github.com/anthropics/agentic-cold-start-audit/commit/b7a5a41))
- **Prompt reuse strategy** (2026-02-28): Added guidance for reusing audit prompts across subsequent rounds instead of regenerating from scratch. When tool structure is stable (no new commands/flags), only container name and date need updating. Reuse skips help text discovery but doesn't change the audit agent's approach — it still runs with zero context. Includes sequencing rules to prevent wasteful parallel execution of filler agent + audit agent. Emerged from brewprune Round 5 where both agents ran unnecessarily in parallel. ([commit 6b54709](https://github.com/anthropics/agentic-cold-start-audit/commit/6b54709))

### Changed
- **Skill restructured to official Claude Code directory format** (2026-03-06): `prompts/cold-start-audit-skill.md` (815-line flat file) converted to `prompts/cold-start-audit-skill/` directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint and three supporting files (`preflight.md`, `container.md`, `filler-agent.md`). Added YAML frontmatter with `name: cold-start-audit`, `disable-model-invocation: true` (prevents auto-trigger on a skill with Docker/file side effects), `allowed-tools`, and `argument-hint`. SKILL.md is now 163 lines — under the 500-line recommendation — with detailed sections loaded on demand from supporting files. Install command updated from `cp ...skill.md ~/.claude/skills/` to `cp -r prompts/cold-start-audit-skill ~/.claude/skills/cold-start-audit`. All documentation references updated (README.md, CLAUDE.md, workflow.md, docs/).
- Skill is now fully self-contained - works from any project directory without cloning the repo
- Filler agent generalized from Homebrew-specific to language/platform-agnostic
- **Methodology clarified: pure discovery, not regression testing** (2026-03-03): Documentation now explicitly states that cold-start audits are pure new-user discovery with zero knowledge of previous rounds. Removed any language suggesting the agent verifies known issues or maintains regression test suites. If old issues regress, they surface naturally through rediscovery (agent hits same friction) rather than explicit verification. This constraint — agent can't know what to check — is the methodology's strength: it simulates what real users encounter without bias from knowing what "should" work. Coverage gaps are acceptable; the goal is finding salient friction that new users actually trip over, not exhaustive correctness validation. Updated README, added explicit "This is pure discovery, not regression testing" paragraph to prevent confusion. ([commit f69fb53](https://github.com/blackwell-systems/agentic-cold-start-audit/commit/f69fb53))

### Pattern Evolution Timeline

The timestamp metadata improvement emerged from real-world usage:

**brewprune Round 4 (2026-02-28):**
- Scout phase produced IMPL doc with 31 P1/P2 findings
- P0 manual fixes committed between scout and wave execution
- Wave 1 launched days later - 7 of 17 findings already implemented (41%)
- **Gap identified:** Can't tell how stale audit findings are
- **Solution:** Add metadata header with audit date, tool version, container, environment

**Result:** Makes staleness visible and helps correlate findings with tool versions
